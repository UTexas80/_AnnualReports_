## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r grad coa, echo=FALSE}
# Load Tabula functions
library(data.table)
library(tabulizer)
library(tabulizerjars)


pdf.file <- "~/AnnualReports/data/02UndergraduateCostOfAttendance.pdf"          # Define path to PDF file
pdf.dat <- extract_tables(pdf.file)                                             # Extract data table
# Coerce output matrix to data.frame
# pdf.tbl <- data.frame(pdf.dat[[1]][-1, ])
pdf.tbl <- data.table(pdf.dat[[1]][-1, ])                                       # Coerce output matrix to data.table
names(pdf.tbl) <- pdf.dat[[1]][1, ]
pie(table(pdf.tbl[2:5,11]))                                                     # create pie chart
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Welcome to ProjectTemplate!

This file introduces you to ProjectTemplate, but you should eventually replace
the contents of this file with an introduction to your project. People who
work with your data in the future will thank you for it, including your future
self.

ProjectTemplate is an R package that helps you organize your statistical
analysis projects. Since you're reading this file, we'll assume that you've
already called `create.project()` to set up this project and all of its
contents.

To load your new project, you'll first need to `setwd()` into the directory
where this README file is located. Then you need to run the following two
lines of R code:

	library('ProjectTemplate')
	load.project()

After you enter the second line of code, you'll see a series of automated
messages as ProjectTemplate goes about doing its work. This work involves:
* Reading in the global configuration file contained in `config`.
* Loading any R packages you listed in he configuration file.
* Reading in any datasets stored in `data` or `cache`.
* Preprocessing your data using the files in the `munge` directory.

Once that's done, you can execute any code you'd like. For every analysis
you create, we'd recommend putting a separate file in the `src` directory.
If the files start with the two lines mentioned above:

	library('ProjectTemplate')
	load.project()

You'll have access to all of your data, already fully preprocessed, and
all of the libraries you want to use.
